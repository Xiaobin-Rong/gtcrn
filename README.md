# GTCRN
This repository is the official implementation of the ICASSP2024 paper: [GTCRN: A Speech Enhancement Model Requiring Ultralow Computational Resources](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10448310).

## About GTCRN
Grouped Temporal Convolutional Recurrent Network (GTCRN) is a speech enhancement model requiring ultralow computational resources, featuring only **23.7 K** parameters and **33.0 MMACs** per second.
Experimental results show that our proposed model not only surpasses RNNoise, a typical lightweight model with similar computational burden, 
but also achieves competitive performance when compared to recent baseline models with significantly higher computational resources requirements.

Note:
* Although the complexity mentioned in the paper is **39.6 MMACs** per second, we find that it can be further reduced to **33.0 MMACs** per second. This reduction can be achieved by modifying only the ERB module, specifically by substituting the invariant mapping from linear bands to ERB bands in the low-frequency dimension, from matrix multiplication to simple concatenation.
* The explicit feature rearrangement layer in the grouped RNN, which is implemented by feature shuffle, can result in an unstreamable model. Therefore, we discard it and implicitly achieve feature rearrangement through the following FC layer in the DPGRNN.

## Performance
Experiments show that GTCRN not only outperforms RNNoise by a substantial margin on the VCTK-DEMAND and DNS3 dataset, but also achieves competitive performance compared to several baseline models with significantly higher computational overhead.
